  <!-- ES - there are multiple dependencies in the XSDs here. Both the service and entity XSDs have xs:imports for 
            entities in Common - book, product etc. Additionally the service contracts xs:import the member entity.
            We generate all XSDs into one CS file to avoid duplication of class generation in the members namespace,
            and we reference the common XSDs and DLL so we don't generate classes already in common-->
